## Overview

Traccar Client is a GPS tracking app for Android and iOS. It runs in the background and sends location updates to your own server using the open-source Traccar platform.

- **Real-time Tracking**: See your device’s location on your private server in real time.
- **Open-Source**: 100% free and open-source, with no ads or tracking.
- **Customizable**: Configure update intervals, accuracy, and data usage to fit your needs.
- **Privacy First**: Your location data is sent only to your chosen server—never to third parties.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with the Traccar server and many third-party GPS tracking platforms.

Just enter your server address, grant location permissions, and the app will automatically send periodic location reports in the background.
